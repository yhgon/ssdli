That post gives a gentle introduction to the basic idea behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and in this lab you will get hands-on experience with some of the RNNs described in the article.\n",

    "## What are RNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are an extension of regular artificial neural networks that add connections feeding the hidden state of the neural network back into itself - these are called recurrent connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for adding these recurrent connections is to provide the network with visibility not just of the current data sample it has been provided, but also it's previous hidden state.  In some sense, this gives the network a sequential memory of what it has seen before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes RNNs applicable in situations where a sequence of data is required to make a classification decision or regression estimate.  For example, you might employ an RNN to predict your future household electricity consumption based on the time-series of instantaneous power draw or you might use an RNN to predict the next word that a person will utter given the previous ten they have said."

    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This toy problem is chosen to demonstrate something you can do with a RNN that you cannot do easily with a regular feed-forward neural network.  The problem is adding up two binary numbers.  For example consider the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binary addition](files/binary_addition_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know how binary addition works, read [this](http://web.math.princeton.edu/math_alive/1/Lab1/BinAdd.html) first.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural network solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We could train a regular feed-forward (fully-connected) neural network to do binary addition.  For example, we could give it the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binary addition FFNN](files/binary_addition_FF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has some obvious limitations though:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have to decide in advance and fix the maximum number of digits in each binary number.\n",
    "- The knowledge learned about adding digits at the beginning of the binary numbers does not get generalized and applied to digits at the end.  We have to learn different weights describing how to add digits at all locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN we are going to train has a very similar structure to a fully-connected neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binary addition RNN](files/binary_addition_RNN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have changed how the network receives input.  Instead of taking in the two whole binary numbers, we just take in one digit at a time from each number and try to predict the corresponding digit in the sum.  It is the job of the RNN to remember whether we have a carried bit from an overflow when we calculated the sum at the last digit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also added connections between the hidden units themselves in addition to the connections between the hidden units and the input and output units.  These additional connections mean that the hidden activity at one time step can influence the hidden activity at the next time step in addition to the influence from the input units at the next time step.  You might ask why we don't just pass the output at the previous time-step as an additional input at the next time-step instead.  Technically you could do this, but you would be missing out on the knowledge (or memory) that the hidden layer can accumulate over multiple time-steps and you would just be influenced by the last time-step alone."

    "The algorithm we will use to train our RNN is the same stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm you have seen in training multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks.  The only difference is in the backpropagation step that computes the weight updates for our slightly more complex network structure.  Study this excellent animation from [@iamtrask's blog](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/) of an RNN being trained on a four step sequence (note that the network architecture is slightly different from our example, but the training process is the same):\n",

    "\n",
    "As information propagates from the input neurons to the hidden neurons over the four timesteps you see that the hidden units become a combined representation of the four inputs.  Once all of the timesteps have been received the output neurons turn black, meaning that the predicted output digits are generated.  The output neurons then turn yellow, meaning that the error in those predictions is calculated.  Then comes the crucial part:  starting at the last output neuron the error gradient is computed and backpropagated to the hidden units for that time-step (the neurons go orange) and this process is also repeated for each of the previous time-steps in order.  Remember when the gradients backpropagate to the hidden units they are coming from both the output neurons and the hidden units one step ahead in the sequence.  We call this process Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).\n",
